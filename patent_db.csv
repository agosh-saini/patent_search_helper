What is claimed is:
 
1. A method of exchanging an electrical energy storage system (EESS) in an electric vehicle, the method comprising:
positioning an electric vehicle in x and y directions on an EESS exchange station, wherein the x direction relates to a direction of travel of the electric vehicle and the y direction is perpendicular to the x direction in a horizontal plane, and wherein the EESS exchange station included first lifts positioned on either side of the electric vehicle in the y direction and second lifts positioned on either side of the electric vehicle in the y direction and outside of the first lifts in the y direction relative to the electric vehicle, the second lifts including battery support structures extending around the first lifts and beneath the vehicle;
after positioning, raising the electric vehicle to a predetermined height using the first lifts;
after raising the electric vehicle, raising the second lifts toward the electric vehicle until the second lifts are correctly positioned relative to a first EESS; after raising the second lifts, unfastening the first EESS from the electric vehicle;
placing an EESS conveyor underneath the first EESS;
after placing the EESS conveyor, lowering the first EESS onto the EESS conveyor using the second lifts;
after lowering the first EESS, removing the first EESS and thereafter placing a second EESS underneath the electric vehicle;
after placing the second EESS underneath the electric vehicle, raising the second EESS toward the electric vehicle using the second lifts until the second EESS is correctly positioned relative to the electric vehicle;
after raising the second EESS, fastening the second EESS onto the electric vehicle; and
after fastening the second EESS, lowering the electric vehicle using the first lifts.


  
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the electric vehicle rolls over horizontal doors while entering the EESS exchange station, wherein the horizontal doors cover the battery support structures, and wherein at least one tube is positioned on each of the horizontal doors for guiding the electric vehicle.

  
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising, after raising the electric vehicle and before raising the second lifts, opening the horizontal doors.

  
4. The method of claim 3, wherein opening the horizontal doors comprises pivoting the door over-center to keep the door open.

  
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the horizontal doors are attached to the battery support structures, and wherein the horizontal doors extend through lifting arms attached to the first lifts after raising the second lifts.

  
6. The method of claim 1, wherein positioning the electric vehicle in at least one of the x and y directions comprises using one or more vehicle chocks.

  
7. The method of claim 1, wherein raising the electric vehicle using the first lifts comprises engaging jack pads on the electric vehicle using lifting arms on the first lifts.

  
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the electric vehicle is suspended at four points.

  
9. The method of claim 7, wherein engaging the jack pads on the electric vehicle using the lifting arms comprises using cone locators for positioning.

  
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the second lifts are raised until they touch an underside of the first EESS.

  
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the first EESS is supported by ball transfer pads attached to the battery support structures.

  
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the second EESS is supported by ball transfer pads attached to the battery support structures, the method further comprising moving the second EESS on the ball transfer pads to align the second EESS with the electric vehicle."
